# Soaring Fountain CBT & School Management Platform

A complete, deployable Next.js (App Router) + Supabase project — not just
source files to copy in. `npm install` and `npm run dev` work directly in
this folder once Supabase env vars are set.

**Deploying this for real? See [`DEPLOYMENT.md`](./DEPLOYMENT.md)** —
step-by-step from this folder to a live URL on GitHub + Supabase + Vercel,
including the one manual step every setup needs (bootstrapping the first
Super Admin account) and a troubleshooting section.

## Setup notes
- Fonts: `app/layout.tsx` already loads **Plus Jakarta Sans** (display)
  and **Inter** (body) via `next/font/google`, exposed as
  `--font-plus-jakarta` / `--font-inter` to match `tailwind.config.ts`.
- Every file with a `// TODO` comment is a stub where real Supabase calls
  (auth, queries) replace sample data — the shapes already mirror the schema.
- Env vars: copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in your Supabase
  project's URL, publishable key, and secret key (see `DEPLOYMENT.md` Part C
  for exactly where to find each one, including a note on Supabase's
  ongoing anon/service_role → publishable/secret key rename).
- Report cards: needs real font files registered with `@react-pdf/renderer`
  (see `public/fonts/README.md`) — the rest of the app doesn't depend on
  this, so it's safe to add later.
- Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts` (and the exported
  function from `middleware` to `proxy`) — this project already uses the
  new convention in `proxy.ts` at the root.

| Backend: start a session — batch-window check, roster check, single-active-session enforcement, stale-session reclaim | `app/api/exam-sessions/start/route.ts` |
| Backend: autosave endpoint (called every 5s by ExamInterface) | `app/api/exam-sessions/answers/route.ts` |
| Backend: submit endpoint — persists final answers, auto-marks objective questions, writes the `results` row | `app/api/exam-sessions/submit/route.ts` |
| Backend: manual-grading endpoint — records a teacher's mark, rolls up `results` once a session is fully graded | `app/api/student-answers/grade/route.ts` |
| Student exam page wired to the above (device fingerprint, loading/error states) | `app/student/exam/[examId]/page.tsx` |

## Still to build
- **Known gap**: creating a teacher doesn't populate `teacher_subjects` —
  that table needs a (teacher, subject, **class**) triple, and the People
  form only collects subjects, not which classes they're taught to. Needs
  its own assignment screen; for now the field is accepted in the UI but
  not persisted.
- Settings' logo upload still saves a `data:` URL straight into
  `school_profile.logo_url` rather than uploading to Supabase Storage first
  — fine for a demo, wasteful for production.
- Report card PDFs need the three Plus Jakarta Sans `.ttf` files added
  manually (see `public/fonts/README.md`) — not yet done as of this build.
- Supabase's **Leaked Password Protection** (checks new passwords against
  HaveIBeenPwned) is off by default and isn't something the project-level
  connector can toggle — Dashboard → Authentication → Policies to enable it.
- Minor performance-only lints remain (a few unindexed foreign keys, some
  policies that re-evaluate `auth.uid()` per row instead of once per query)
  — fine at this school's scale, not worth the migration churn yet.

| Auth: real Supabase sign-in (student PIN + staff password), pre-auth admission-number lookup | `app/login/page.tsx`, `app/api/auth/resolve-student-email/route.ts`, `lib/supabase/admin.ts` |
| Auth: session-refresh + route-protection proxy (Next.js 16 renamed `middleware.ts` to `proxy.ts`) | `proxy.ts` |
| Auth: shared "who's signed in" hook, used instead of hardcoded userName props | `lib/useAuthUser.ts` |
| Schema: added the three tables Lab Batches/Settings needed (`lab_rooms`, `batch_templates`, singleton `school_profile`) + their RLS policies | `database/schema.sql` §8 |
| Admin: every screen now runs on real Supabase queries | `app/admin/**/page.tsx` |
| Teacher: every screen (Question Bank, Exam Builder, Grading Queue, Class Analytics) now runs on real Supabase queries | `app/teacher/**/page.tsx` |
| Student: Exam Launchpad now shows the signed-in student's actual batches/results, not hardcoded sample data | `app/student/page.tsx` |
| Exam Builder: added the missing `isTerminal` toggle — without it, every exam defaulted to "not terminal" and report cards' Terminal column would always show 0 | `components/teacher/ExamBuilder.tsx` |

**Critical fixes found via Supabase's own security linter and a full RLS
audit** (these were live bugs, not applied to a copy — caught after the
first real deploy):
- 8 tables had **no RLS policy at all** (`academic_sessions`, `terms`,
  `classes`, `subjects`, `class_subjects`, `teacher_subjects`,
  `exam_questions`, `grading_scale`) — wide open to the publishable key.
  4 more (`exams`, `exam_batches`, `batch_students`, `term_subject_results`)
  had RLS *enabled* with zero policies — locked shut, even for admins.
- `question_options` was the same "locked shut" case — fixed by design to
  stay that way for direct client reads (`is_correct` must never be
  queryable by a student), with app code reading it via the service-role
  client instead.
- **The exam-taking flow itself was broken**: `/api/exam-sessions/start`,
  `/answers`, and `/submit` all queried `questions`/`question_options`
  using the RLS-bound client — but students have no SELECT policy on
  either table. In practice this meant empty exams, autosave silently
  mis-filing every multiple-choice answer as free text, and every
  objective question auto-graded as wrong regardless of the real answer.
  All three routes now use the service-role client, since each already
  re-implements its own authorization in code (batch window, roster,
  single-session enforcement) — that's the real boundary, not RLS.
- `/api/student-answers/grade` had the identical issue for the *write*
  side: a teacher grading another student's answer would have the update
  silently affect zero rows under RLS — no error, nothing saved. Same fix.
- Added a `teacher_read_student_answers` policy so Grading Queue and Class
  Analytics can read (never write) other students' answers directly —
  the one case where extending RLS was cleaner than another API route.

**Every screen across all three portals is now wired to real Supabase —
none of the sample-data constants from earlier passes remain anywhere in
`app/`.**

**Since the first live deploy, two more real bugs surfaced and got fixed:**
- A stray extra `)` in `app/student/page.tsx`'s Supabase select string —
  these strings are type-checked at compile time, so a malformed one
  produces a `ParserError` type rather than a normal syntax error.
- `teacher_subjects` was a real, working table with nothing populating or
  reading it — Question Bank and Exam Builder showed every teacher every
  subject in the school. Closed the loop both ways: the People screen now
  has a real subject-and-class assignment editor per teacher (writing to
  `teacher_subjects`), and Question Bank/Exam Builder now filter to a
  signed-in teacher's actual assignments — falling back to showing
  everything only if a teacher has zero assignments yet, so nobody's ever
  completely stuck.

**The Super Admin bootstrap is done** — Moses (`ogmoses321@gmail.com`) is
`super_admin` in `public.users`, matching the Supabase Auth user created
by hand. Grading scale defaults (A–F) are seeded. Classes, subjects, and
real students/teachers still need creating through the app.

**Deliberately not done, and why:** Settings' logo upload still saves a
`data:` URL instead of uploading to Supabase Storage. Fixing it properly
means creating a bucket, writing its RLS policies, and rewriting the
upload handlers in two components — real work with real risk of new bugs,
and unlike everything above, a `data:` URL logo doesn't break anything,
it's just inefficient. Left for a dedicated pass rather than rushed here.

## Pass 4: two real 404s, loading states, mobile overflow, and the invite flow

**Two pages the app promised and never built:**
- `app/teacher/page.tsx` (Teacher Overview) didn't exist at all — the
  sidebar linked to it *and* the login flow redirected every teacher
  straight there, so signing in as a teacher was a guaranteed 404. Built
  it for real: stat cards, today's batches across the teacher's own
  exams, quick links to the other four teacher screens.
- `app/student/batches/page.tsx` and `app/student/results/page.tsx` —
  same story, linked from the student sidebar since the beginning, routes
  never created. Built as focused pages (full history/schedule, not just
  the launchpad's summary), not just redirects back to `/student`.

**Blank-screen-during-load, fixed everywhere at once:** every dashboard
page used to `return null` while its data fetched, which read as the app
freezing rather than loading. Added `components/layout/PageLoading.tsx`
and swapped it into all 12 pages that had the old pattern, plus the 3
new ones — `DashboardLayout` (sidebar/navbar) now renders immediately
either way, only the content area shows the loading state.

**Mobile layout overflow** (the screenshots): `SettingsManager`'s grading
scale editor forced 5 fixed grid columns with no mobile fallback — wide
enough to overflow a phone screen and drag the *whole page* into
horizontal scroll, which is why unrelated content looked clipped/shifted
in the screenshots too, not just that one table. Rebuilt it with a real
mobile layout (stacked cards) below `sm:`, kept the grid table above it.
Also found `PersonEditor`'s subject/class dropdowns missing `min-w-0` —
native `<select>` elements don't shrink below their content's width in a
flex row without it, a second real contributor to the same symptom.
Audited the whole project for both patterns (fixed-column grids without
a mobile breakpoint; flex-1 inputs/selects without min-w-0) — these were
the only instances. Added `overflow-x: hidden` on `html`/`body` in
`globals.css` as a backstop regardless.

**Teacher accounts now use a real invite-by-email flow, students a
4-digit PIN:**
- Creating a teacher (single or via bulk import) now calls Supabase's
  `inviteUserByEmail` instead of generating a password — no credential
  exists for the admin to share; the teacher gets an actual email, clicks
  it, and lands on the new `app/register/page.tsx` to set their own
  password, then routes to `/teacher` (or `/admin` if invited as an
  admin).
- Students dropped from a 6-digit to a 4-digit PIN, still admin-generated
  and shown once.
- **Needs one manual step to actually work**: Supabase → Authentication →
  URL Configuration → **Redirect URLs** needs the deployed domain's
  `/register` path added (e.g. `https://your-app.vercel.app/register`),
  or invite links will fail to redirect. Also worth knowing: Supabase's
  built-in email sender is rate-limited and meant for testing — a school
  actually inviting many teachers wants real SMTP configured under
  Authentication → Emails.

## Pass 5: the mobile overflow's actual root cause, and a resend-access action

**The mobile overflow bug had a specific, identifiable cause**, not just
"needs more responsive tweaking": iOS Safari auto-detects and auto-links
plain-text emails/phone numbers/dates in page content by default — which
is why the teacher's email rendered as an unstyled blue underlined link
in the screenshots, and very likely why its `text-overflow: ellipsis`
truncation broke (a known WebKit quirk: the auto-injected `<a>` tag
disrupts the parent's ellipsis calculation). Added `format-detection:
telephone=no, email=no, address=no, date=no` to the root layout's
metadata, which disables this globally in one place rather than needing
a per-component workaround.

**Audited every list-row-with-action-buttons pattern in the app** for the
underlying structural risk (name/email text competing horizontally with
multiple buttons in a row that doesn't stack on mobile) — `PeopleManager`
was the only one actually broken (4 possible buttons + two lines of
often-long text), but rebuilt it and 4 other, lower-risk rows
(`AcademicsManager`'s classes/subjects, `LabBatchesManager`'s
templates/rooms) to stack vertically below `sm:` regardless, since a
`ReportCardsManager` row already used this pattern from the start and it
held up fine.

**Added a real "resend access" action** for teacher rows — sends a
password-reset email (via `resetPasswordForEmail`, which works whether
or not the account already has a password) and reuses the existing
`/register` page to complete it. This is the actual fix for "the
credentials I set aren't working": the account's own history in
`auth.users` showed a password *was* set successfully once already — the
issue was a forgotten/mistyped password, not a broken flow, and there
was previously no way to recover from that without me manually
intervening in the database. Now there is.
